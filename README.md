#Camel Case in JS
You'll remember that by convention in Python we used snake_case to write variable names. In JavaScript, the convention we encourage is to use camelCase.

Here are some casing examples:

- camelCase
- snake_case
- PascalCase
- SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE

We aren't choosing these casing rules arbitrarily - it's true that the Python community as a whole prefers snake_case, while the JavaScript community tends to prefer camelCase.
